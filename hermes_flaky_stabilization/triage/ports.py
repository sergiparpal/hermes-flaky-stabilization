"""Typed ports for the Hermes capabilities this plugin depends on.

The plugin follows a ports-and-adapters shape: ``__init__.register`` is the only
adapter that touches Hermes, and it *injects* the host's ``llm`` and
``dispatch_tool`` into the otherwise pure-stdlib pipeline. Those capabilities
used to cross the boundary as bare ``Any`` / ``Callable``; this module names the
narrow surface each one must satisfy (Interface Segregation — depend only on the
methods actually called) so the contract is explicit, type-checkable, and easy
to fake in tests.

These are :class:`typing.Protocol` definitions: structural, import-only, and
stdlib. They impose no runtime requirement on the real Hermes objects — the host
``ctx.llm`` already satisfies :class:`LlmPort` by shape, no registration needed.
