"""Single source of truth for the CI-failure taxonomy.

The taxonomy is a contract that previously lived, hand-synced, in five places:
the LLM JSON-schema enum, the prose category definitions in the classifier
prompt, the ordered heuristic fallback rules, the tool-schema ``description``,
and the README table. This module collapses the *code-level* copies into one:
:data:`CATEGORIES` defines each category once — its key, a one-line summary, the
prose definition handed to the model, and its rule-based fallback signal — and
every other code representation is derived here.

Add, remove, or re-word a category in exactly one place: :data:`CATEGORIES`.
``tests/test_taxonomy.py`` guards the two representations that cannot be derived
(the tool ``description`` and the README table) by asserting they mention every
key, so drift fails the suite instead of shipping silently.

Pure standard library; no Hermes dependency.
