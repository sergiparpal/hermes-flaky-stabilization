"""CI-triage stage (ported from hermes-ci-triage).

Registers one tool, ``triage_pipeline_failure``, in the ``ci_triage`` toolset.
The tool fetches a CI log (local path or https URL), pre-filters it to a
bounded excerpt, asks the host LLM to classify the failure into a fixed
taxonomy (with a deterministic rule-based fallback), and learns the failure
pattern per project in the consolidated ``state.db``.

This module is the only file in the stage that touches Hermes; the heavy
lifting lives in pure-stdlib siblings (``logfetch``, ``prefilter``,
``classifier``, ``patterns``, ``handlers``) which import nothing from Hermes
and unit-test in isolation. Unified-plugin adaptation: ``enable_enrichment``
now resolves from the unified config's ``triage`` section (Appendix B) with
the legacy constant as the default.
